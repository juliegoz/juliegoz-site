I've been lucky enough to live in cities like Lima, Los Angeles, and Washington DC, and now I get to live full-time in New York City. 

I graduated from The University of Maryland, with a degree in Communication Studies, Theatre, and Professional Writing.

I grew up listening to a lot of Peter Gabriel, U2, and Duran Duran, I can still name most if not all of their discography to this day. If you shuffle my music, you can go from Tchaikovsky to Louis Armstrong, to Megan Thee Stallion.

I rediscovered my love of chess during the pandemic, partly due to The Queen's Gambit, and I'm always down for a round with anyone! 

Thanks for visiting my site!
