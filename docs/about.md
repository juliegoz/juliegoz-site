---
Born in Peru, raised and currently living in the Washington DC area, local hire in NYC. 

Graduated from The University of Maryland, with a degree in Communication Studies, Theatre, and Professional Writing.

I grew up listening to a lot of Peter Gabriel, U2, and Duran Duran, I can still name most if not all of their discography to this day. If you shuffle my music, you can go from Tchaikovsky to Louis Armstrong, to Megan Thee Stallion.

I became really good at chess during the pandemic, and I can beat almost anyone at it. You can usually catch me running around the city with a travel chess set in my backpack.

If Elle Woods and Fiona from Shameless had a baby it would be me. 

My favorite book is Eragon, favorite movie is Singin' in the Rain, favorite actor is Willem Dafoe. Thanks for visiting my site!
