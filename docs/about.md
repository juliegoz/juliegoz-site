---
She is a bilingual Peruvian American SAG-e actress, singer, and musician, with an extensive theater background and strong comedy chops. She excels at playing the duality of a vivacious sweetheart with a mischievous spark and a bratty bombshell with a sarcastic bite. She has a strong passion for new and devised work centered around the Latin√© and immigrant experience.

She studied at The University of Maryland, where on top of working part time and acting professionally onstage, she obtained a degree in Communication, Theatre, and Professional Writing. 

She has been fortunate to continue exploring her love of storytelling, and work with Heidi Marshall Studio, Jamie Carroll, Upright Citizens Brigade, and more.
