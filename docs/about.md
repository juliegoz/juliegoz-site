I've been lucky enough throughout my life to live in cities like Lima, Los Angeles, and Washington DC, but now I get to call Brooklyn my home as I get to tell stories for a living.

I studied at The University of Maryland, where on top of working part time and acting professionally onstage, I obtained a degree in Communication Studies, Theatre, and Professional Writing.

Since I've graduated, I've been so fortunate to continue exploring my love of storytelling, and I've gotten the chance to work with Heidi Marshall Studio, Jamie Carroll, Upright Citizens Brigade, and more.

Thanks for checking me out!
