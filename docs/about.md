She currently works as an Associate Producer for the Latiné Musical Theatre Lab, a New York based organization that develops and advocates for new Latiné written works of musical theatre.

She has been fortunate to continue exploring her love of storytelling, and work with Heidi Marshall Studio, Jamie Carroll, Upright Citizens Brigade, and more.
