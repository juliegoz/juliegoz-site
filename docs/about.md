header_text: Hi! My name Julieta and here's a little about me 
---
I was born in Peru, raised and currently living in the Washington DC area, I've been working as an actor for the past 4 years. I graduated from The University of Maryland, with a degree in Communication Studies, Theatre, and Professional Writing.

While I was still a student, I had the opportunity to begin my professional career performing with Helen Hayes Nominated companies such as Monumental Theatre Company, Ally Theatre Company, Adventure Theatre, and Flying V. In film, I've worked as an actor and model for companies including Apple INC., Washington Nationals, Six Flags, Destination DC, WTOP News, and the University of Maryland.

If Elle Woods and Fiona from Shameless had a baby it would be me. In my spare time, I love beating almost anyone at chess, petting dogs I comes across on the street, exploring fun undiscovered spots in the city and drinking way too much bubble tea.
