She is a proud first generation Peruvian actor, singer, and musician. She has a strong passion for new and devised work centered around the latiné and immigrant experience.

She studied at The University of Maryland, where on top of working part time and acting professionally onstage, she obtained a degree in Communication, Theatre, and Professional Writing. 

She currently works as an Associate Producer for the Latiné Musical Theatre Lab, a New York based organization that develops and advocates for new latiné written works of musical theatre.

She has been fortunate to continue exploring her love of storytelling, and work with Heidi Marshall Studio, Jamie Carroll, Upright Citizens Brigade, and more.

She is represented by Bonafide and Emerging Artists and Bramante Artists.
