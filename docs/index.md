      title: "Infinite Future: Bernstein's Lasting Impact"
      quote: "A marvelous current composer – Lin-Manuel Miranda – certainly seems to be influenced by Bernstein, and his pulsating song “Carnival De Barrio” from In the Heights was delivered with a lusty and earthy interpretation by Julieta Gozalo that was absolutely thrilling to listen to."

      title: "The Head That Wears The Crown"
      quote: "Julieta Gozalo is unforgettable as Bethanie. Like all of Villanueva’s characters, Bethanie’s perfect life is only skin-deep, and Gozalo provides a very genuine feeling to a girl who uses high school politics as a coping mechanism for troubling home issues. Gozalo navigates the character’s age change from the first half to the second half incredibly well, growing from submissive to her friends, to ambivalent without any feeling of emotional whiplash."

      title: "Crystal Creek Motel"
      quote: "One of the most unifying and delightful aspects of the show is the cleaning staff, played by Gozalo and Denman, who not only reset the stage between each scene, but also get their own, nearly wordless yet entirely satisfying, story arc."

    date: "February 2018"
    text: "Julieta made her Monumental Theatre Company debut in Infinite Future: Bernstein's Lasting Impact, a new, collaboratively devised, cabaret-style show that explores the influence of Leonard Bernstein’s musicals on contemporary musical theatre that celebrates Leonard Bernstein's 100th birthday. \n'Directed by Bridget Grace Sheaff, the performance includes music from West Side Story and On the Town. The show’s creators take inspiration from Bernstein’s idea that: “A liberal is a man or a woman or a child who looks forward to a better day, a more tranquil night, and a bright, infinite future.” This performance looks at the ways in which today’s musical theatre follows in Bernstein’s footsteps by tackling thorny issues from everyday life with the hope of a better future.'"
